# FiveM Map and Vehicle Resources Initialization

## Overview
This README documents the setup for initializing map source and vehicle source with FiveM, detailing the required metafiles for vehicles and maps. This setup aims to comprehensively include all necessary items for seamless integration.

## Requirements
- FiveM Server
- Appropriate access rights to modify server resources

## Installation

1. Navigate to your FiveM resource directory.
2. Create a new folder for your map and vehicle resource, e.g., `map_vehicle_resources`.
3. Inside this new folder, place the provided meta files and Lua scripts.

## Resource Manifest

Include the resource manifest file at the top of your `__resource.lua` or `fxmanifest.lua` file:

```lua
resource_manifest_version '77731fab-63ca-442c-a67b-abc70f28dfa5'
```

## Meta Files

You need to include the following meta files in your resource folder:

- `vehicles.meta`
- `carvariations.meta`
- `carcols.meta`
- `handling.meta`
- `dlctext.meta`
- `contentunlocks.meta`
- `vehiclelayouts.meta`
- `shop_vehicle.meta`

## Data Files

Register the data files in your `__resource.lua` or `fxmanifest.lua` with the following lines:

```lua
files {
    'vehicles.meta',
    'carvariations.meta',
    'carcols.meta',
    'handling.meta',
    'dlctext.meta',
    'contentunlocks.meta',
    'vehiclelayouts.meta',
    'shop_vehicle.meta'
}

data_file 'HANDLING_FILE' 'handling.meta'
data_file 'VEHICLE_METADATA_FILE' 'vehicles.meta'
data_file 'CARCOLS_FILE' 'carcols.meta'
data_file 'VEHICLE_VARIATION_FILE' 'carvariations.meta'
data_file 'DLCTEXT_FILE' 'dlctext.meta'
data_file 'CONTENT_UNLOCKING_META_FILE' 'contentunlocks.meta'
data_file 'VEHICLE_LAYOUTS_FILE' 'vehiclelayouts.meta'
data_file 'VEHICLE_SHOP_DLC_FILE' 'shop_vehicle.meta'
```

## Scripts

Include the client scripts in your resource manifest as well:

```lua
client_script 'vehicle_names.lua'
```

## Additional Map Details

For the map initialization process, make sure to include:

```lua
this_is_a_map 'yes'
client_script 'client.lua'
data_file 'DLC_ITYP_REQUEST' 'idsc_maps.ytyp'
```

If there are additional files or data, include them as needed:

```lua
data_file 'A' '' 
file ''
```

## Usage

After setup, your FiveM server will recognize the vehicle and map source files, allowing for proper in-game integration.

## Support

If you encounter any issues during setup or have any questions, refer to the FiveM documentation or the community forums for assistance.

Remember to replace placeholders with actual file paths if they are located in subdirectories. For real-world usage, actual file names and paths must match those on the server and within the script.
